    <h1>Bio:</h1>
    <p id="specialblue">I am a girl who codes from Sumware, CA. I will be in the 12th grade in the fall, and I am looking forward to applying to colleges. I live at home with my mom, my brother, and my cat named Seymore. When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to music with my friends or reading.</p>

      <strong>Dislikes:</strong> I really don't like fish. They have dead eyes that freak me out!
